# Chrome Extension Boilerplate with React 18 and Webpack 5

## Webpack auto-reload and HRM

To make your workflow much more efficient this boilerplate uses the [webpack server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) to development (started with `npm start`) with auto reload feature that reloads the browser automatically every time that you save some file in your editor.

You can run the dev mode on other port if you want. Just specify the env var `port` like this:

```
$ PORT=6002 npm run start
```

## Content Scripts

Although this boilerplate uses the webpack dev server, it's also prepared to write all your bundles files on the disk at every code change, so you can point, on your extension manifest, to your bundles that you want to use as [content scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts), but you need to exclude these entry points from hot reloading [(why?)](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate/issues/4#issuecomment-261788690). To do so you need to expose which entry points are content scripts on the `webpack.config.js` using the `chromeExtensionBoilerplate -> notHotReload` config. Look the example below.

Let's say that you want use the `myContentScript` entry point as content script, so on your `webpack.config.js` you will configure the entry point and exclude it from hot reloading, like this:

```js
{
  …
  entry: {
    myContentScript: "./src/js/myContentScript.js"
  },
  chromeExtensionBoilerplate: {
    notHotReload: ["myContentScript"]
  }
  …
}
```

and on your `src/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://www.google.com/*"],
      "js": ["myContentScript.bundle.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Packing

After the development of your extension run the command

```
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.
